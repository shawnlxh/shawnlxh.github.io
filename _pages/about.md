This is Xiaohan Li (李霄寒).
I am a Senior Data Scientist at Walmart Global Tech. I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), under the supervision of [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/).  

My research interests are large language models, multi-modal language models, diffusion models, and recommender systems. Now I am working on Generative AI applications in e-commerce and recommender systems.
