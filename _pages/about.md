This is Xiaohan Li.
I am a first year Ph.D student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, under the supervision of [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/PSYu/).  

My research interests are data mining and machine learning. Now I am working on deep learning applications in recommender system.
